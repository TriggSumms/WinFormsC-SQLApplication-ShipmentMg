# ... This is a practice application aimed at working with several older technoligies. 
    *Using C#/.NET &.... WINFORMs to display ....as well as programs (SQL Server Express 2017 / SQL Server Management Studio)
    * Design an application allowing:
    * Our client is looking for a WinForms application that must be written in C#. They are
      looking to load containers into a truck for shipment to their customer. They will need the ability to key
      in Shipment and Container IDs and have them detailed in a visual list when completed.
    > Restriction: User will enter a Shipment ID on the form. After creating the Shipment ID, the user will need
      the ability to enter in Container IDs. Some clients will require these to be numeric only, some will not.
      Once the user has added all Container IDs, they will need the ability to complete the process by posting
      the shipment.
    > Restriction: Once a shipment is posted, this form will appear on the screen and allow the user to view a
      detailed list view of all Container IDs for the Shipment ID that was just posted.
    > Also extra: *throw in an employee Id and property selector
    
> ## Concept learned ...
    
 
    *An older approach to C# using concepts like MDI application, LINQ populating, ADO.NET models, and several structural tricks that were unfamiliar before starting this    project
    *Basic CRUD Achieved, etc
    *Multiple forms created
